 https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-2/

 The network classifies digits from the MNIST digits database with an average
 accuracy of about 90%.

 The CNN consists of four layers namely: 
 -the convolution layer(Convolution.java) 
 -the maximum pooling layer (MaxPool.java) 
 -the softmax activation layer (SoftMax.java) 
 -the output layer that implements cross-entropy loss.
 
 # USAGE
 Import the project into your favorite IDE and run the CNN.java file.
