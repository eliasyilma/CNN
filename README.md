# CNN
A Simple Convolutional Neural Network based on the tutorial by Victor Zhou at

 https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-2/
 
 The network classifies digits from the MNIST digits database with an average
 accuracy of about 90%.

 The CNN consists of four layers namely: 
 -the convolution layer(Convolution.java) 
 -the maximum pooling layer (MaxPool.java) 
 -the softmax activation layer (SoftMax.java) 
 -the output layer that implements cross-entropy loss.
 
 # USAGE
 1. Import the project into your favorite IDE.
 
 2. Go to the data folder and unzip MNIST.zip into that same destination folder.(Use 'extract here...')
 (Your project directory should read /CNN/data/data/mnist_png/mnist_png/training/)
 
 3. run the CNN.java file.
